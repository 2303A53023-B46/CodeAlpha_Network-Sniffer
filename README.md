Task 1-Basic Network Sniffer  | Code Alpha Cyber Security Internship

# 🔍 Network Packet Sniffer

### 👩‍💻 Internship: Code Alpha – Cyber Security

This is *Task 1* of the Code Alpha Internship, where I built a simple *network sniffer* using Python and Scapy.

---

## 🔧 Features
- Captures live packets using Scapy
- Displays source → destination IPs
- Shows protocol type (TCP/UDP/Other)

---

## 💻 How to Run
1. Install Python & Scapy:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy

2. Run the script as admin:

   python sniffer.py


📷 Sample Output

151.101.38.172 --> 192.168.33.17 | Protocol: TCP
